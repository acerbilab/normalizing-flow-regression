# 📚 Paper in Markdown

> **tl;dr:** This folder contains the paper converted to plain-text Markdown with AI-generated descriptions of figures, making it easily accessible for large language model (LLM) analysis and interactions, for both humans and machines.

A full list of our papers in Markdown is available [here](https://github.com/acerbilab/pubs-llms).

### Content

For practical usage, the paper is available in full as well as split into multiple parts:

| **Part**       | **Description**                                                                | **File**                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Text**  | Combined version with all parts in a single document.                          | [full](li2025normalizing_full.md)             |
| **Main Text**  | The core content of the paper.                                                 | [main](li2025normalizing_main.md)             |
| **Backmatter** | References, acknowledgments, and other auxiliary content rarely fed to an LLM. | [backmatter](li2025normalizing_backmatter.md) |
| **Appendix**   | Supplementary materials, when available.                                       | [appendix](li2025normalizing_appendix.md)     |
| **Overview**   | Summary of main results and key takeaways (from the paper webpage).            | [overview](li2025normalizing_overview.md)             |

### Usage Guide

- **Quick usage:** Navigate to the part of interest, click "Copy raw file" on GitHub, paste the full content or individual parts and excerpts into your LLM chat to ask questions about the paper.
- **Luigi's usage:** Include relevant papers in project repositories for use with advanced LLM assistants. Luigi uses Athanor (an in-house LLM research and coding assistant), but other options include [Aider](https://aider.chat/), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview), and keep growing.

### Technical Details

The paper-to-Markdown conversion process uses [paper2llm](https://lacerbi.github.io/paper2llm/), with [Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr) for text and table extraction and [Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/) for image-to-text descriptions.

### Disclaimer

<details>
<summary>Important notes about conversion accuracy.</summary>

- Papers have been converted automatically with minimal human intervention.
- OCR models have now become extremely robust, and vision models show practical utility in image understanding, but occasional inaccuracies may occur.
- **Errors** may take the form of missing sentences near non-standard page formatting, typos in equations or tables, or image descriptions missing or misrepresenting parts of the figure.
- Please **report such mistakes** by raising a GitHub issue.

For non-critical applications, we consider that the benefit of having LLM-friendly access to research papers outweigh the potential inaccuracies, which generally do not affect the gist of the paper. As usual, double-check key assumptions and results.
